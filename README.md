## App Concept

### Use Case
- **Problem Statement**:  
  Many Sanrio fans and digital card collectors face the challenge of organizing and managing their growing collections. There is a lack of a dedicated mobile app that combines the joy of collecting Sanrio-themed digital cards with the ability to personalize and share collections in a fun, casual, and stress-free environment.
  
- **Target User**:  
  - **Primary Audience**:  
    - Sanrio fans of all ages.  
    - Users who enjoy digital collecting and personalization (e.g., Trading Card Game (TCG) enthusiasts).
  - **Secondary Audience**:  
    - People looking for a casual, visually appealing, and stress-free app experience.
    - Users interested in digital albums and interactive content based on popular Sanrio characters.

- **Solution**:  
  - **Sanrio Card Collector** is a mobile app that provides a delightful experience for users to collect, organize, and showcase digital cards featuring their favorite Sanrio characters. The app allows users to:
    - Collect new cards by completing challenges.
    - Organize their cards into personalized digital albums.
    - Sell cards to gain coins and purchase new card packs.
    - Share their collections with others in a casual, fun environment.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Home Screen**: Displays challenges and a summary of the user’s collection progress.
  - **Card Collection Screen**: Shows all collected cards in a grid view. Users can tap a card to view its details (e.g., description, rarity). Users can also sell cards to gain coins.
  - **Albums Screen**: View, edit, and delete personalized albums.
  - **Card Shop Screen**: Users can purchase card packs using earned coins.
  - **Info / Help Screen**: Provides drop chances and rarities for all cards, along with detailed app explanations and credits.

- **Similar Applications**:
  - **Panini Digital Sticker Album**: Allows users to collect digital stickers and trade them with friends. However, it lacks personalization features and doesn’t focus on a specific theme like Sanrio.
  - **Topps Digital Card Trader**: A digital trading card app that allows users to collect and trade sports and entertainment-themed cards. While it provides similar functionality, it does not focus on the cute and thematic appeal of Sanrio characters.
  
- **Difference from Similar Apps**:
  - Unlike existing digital card collection apps, **Sanrio Card Collector** focuses exclusively on Sanrio characters, offering a unique and thematic experience.
  - The app emphasizes **personalization** with the ability to create and share custom digital albums, setting it apart from more generic collection apps.
  - The **casual, non-competitive nature** of the app provides a stress-free experience, which differentiates it from other apps that may focus more on trading or competition.
